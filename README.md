I will show you how to make a calculator using JavaScript, HTML & CSS. I.e. will share the source code of JavaScript calculator. This is very simple but useful program.
Copy these codes and save it with the name that is given here. use can use IDE as well as notepad in windows. I would recommend that first understand this code and then use it anywhere. So, if you have to make it yourself, you do not have to copy the code repeatedly.

I had been created in 2 separate files So that the code does not get long. Generate two files first “calculator.html” second “style.css and then js file.
